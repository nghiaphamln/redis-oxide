## Rust Edition Upgrade Plan

### Rust 2024 Edition Considerations
Rust 2024 edition is expected to be released in 2025. At that time, we will evaluate upgrading based on:

- Stability and ecosystem support
- Migration effort required
- Benefits vs. risks
- Compatibility with existing codebase
- Timeline for ecosystem adoption

### Upgrade Timeline (Conditional)
- [ ] Monitor Rust 2024 edition release and stability
- [ ] Evaluate ecosystem readiness and dependency support
- [ ] Plan migration if benefits justify effort
- [ ] Test thoroughly in staging environment
- [ ] Schedule upgrade for major version release

**Note**: Currently, Rust 2024 edition is not stable and should not be used for production libraries. We will wait for official release and ecosystem adoption before considering an upgrade.
